**ref107** - The 107 [NCBI reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/reference/) bacterial and archaeal genomes.

 - `tree.nwk`: phylogenetic tree of the 107 genomes. Node labels are bootstrap support values.

 - `tree.labeled.nwk`: phylogenetic tree with node labels replaced by sequential node IDs (N1, N2, N3...)

 - `tree.labeled.pdf`: a figure of the tree rendered by [FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).

 - `metadata.tsv`: metadata of the 107 genomes, including alternative identifiers (such as `asm_name` and `taxid`), taxonomic names and ranks (`kingdom` to `species`), and continuous variables (such as `genome_size` and `contamination`).

 - `S22205.abund.txt` and `S22282.abund.txt`: metagenomic profiling result of two samples (S22205 and S22282). Relative abundance was computed for terminal tips (genomes) and internal nodes (N1, N2...).
